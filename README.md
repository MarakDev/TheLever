# The Lever

Prototype of a clicker game where you pull a lever to earn points. As you progress, you can hire helpers to increase your earnings and gradually automate the process.

## How it was made
This game was made entirely by me in tree days, using only Unity and C#.

## What I implemented
The game features a roguelike upgrade system, with upgrades appearing randomly according to their rarity.
